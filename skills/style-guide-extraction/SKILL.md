# Style Guide Extraction

Turn any website's visual style into a reusable design system. Three phases — each is a separate subcommand so you can enter the pipeline wherever makes sense.

**Why this pipeline exists:** Screenshots alone give AI agents ~60-70% style fidelity. The missing details (exact colors, font weights, spacing tokens, subtle shadows) live in the CSS. By combining real CSS extraction with iterative human review, you build a reference implementation that captures 100% of the style — then distill it into a portable guide.

## Subcommands

- `/sge design [url]` — Capture a reference page and recreate it as `design.html`
- `/sge styleguide` — Generate a detailed style guide from the finished `design.html`
- `/sge build [description]` — Build new UI using the style guide

If called without a subcommand (`/sge`), briefly explain the three phases and ask the user which step they're on.

---

## Phase 1: Design (`/sge design`)

**Goal:** Produce a single `design.html` file that faithfully recreates the user's reference website style. This becomes the source of truth for everything that follows.

There are three paths into this phase, in preference order. **Default to Path A** (Playwright MCP). If Playwright MCP isn't installed, fall back to Path B (curl + raw CSS parsing — works for static sites). If the site is JS-rendered or behind auth and no MCP is available, use Path C (user pastes HTML/CSS from dev tools).

### Path A: URL → subagent via Playwright MCP (default, if MCP available)

Spawn a **general-purpose subagent** to handle all the browser work. This keeps the raw HTML/CSS noise out of the main conversation context — the subagent digests it and hands back only a compact design brief.

#### What to tell the subagent

Give it a prompt like this (adapt as needed):

```
You have access to Playwright MCP browser tools. Your job is to extract the
visual design from <URL> and save the results to ./sge-capture/, then return
a compact design brief.

Steps:
1. Navigate to <URL>
2. Check if the page requires auth (login form, redirect to /login, blank/empty
   content, etc.). If yes, stop and return {"needs_auth": true, "current_url": "..."}.
3. Disable CSS animations by evaluating this JS:
     const s = document.createElement('style');
     s.textContent = '*,*::before,*::after{animation-duration:0.001ms!important;transition-duration:0.001ms!important}';
     document.head.appendChild(s);
4. Scroll through the full page (scroll to bottom in steps, then back to top)
   to trigger lazy loading and intersection observers. Wait ~1s after scrolling.
5. Take a full-page screenshot → save to ./sge-capture/reference.png
6. Extract outer HTML (post-JS): document.documentElement.outerHTML
   → save to ./sge-capture/reference.html
7. Extract all CSS — inline <style> blocks + text of all loaded stylesheets:
   Array.from(document.styleSheets).map(s => {
     try { return '/* '+s.href+' */\n'+Array.from(s.cssRules).map(r=>r.cssText).join('\n') }
     catch(e) { return '/* blocked: '+s.href+' */' }
   }).join('\n\n')
   Plus: Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('style')).map(s=>s.textContent).join('\n\n')
   Combine and save to ./sge-capture/reference.css
8. Get computed styles for: body, h1, h2, h3, h4, p, a, button, nav, header,
   footer, section, input — for each selector capture: color, backgroundColor,
   fontFamily, fontSize, fontWeight, lineHeight, letterSpacing, padding, margin,
   borderRadius, boxShadow
   Save as JSON to ./sge-capture/computed.json
9. Save {"final_url": page.url, "title": document.title} to ./sge-capture/meta.json

Then analyze everything and return ONLY this compact design brief (not the raw files):
{
  "final_url": "...",
  "title": "...",
  "theme": "dark" or "light",
  "fonts": {"primary": "...", "mono": "..." (if any)},
  "colors": {
    "background": "#...",
    "surface": "#... (card/panel bg if different)",
    "text": "#...",
    "text_muted": "#... (secondary/dimmed text)",
    "accent": "#... (primary CTA/brand color)",
    "border": "#..."
  },
  "type_scale": [
    {"selector": "h1", "size": "68px", "weight": "400", "tracking": "-1.7px", "color": "..."},
    ... (h2, h3, p, nav, button)
  ],
  "spacing": {
    "section_padding": "...",
    "card_padding": "...",
    "button_padding": "..."
  },
  "border_radius": {"button": "...", "card": "..."},
  "shadows": ["..."],
  "page_sections": ["nav", "hero", "features", ...],
  "key_headings": ["exact text of h1", "exact text of h2s..."]
}
```

#### Auth HITL (if subagent returns `needs_auth: true`)

The Playwright MCP browser runs **headed by default** — the user can see it on their screen.

1. Tell the user: "Browser is open at `<current_url>`. Log in and navigate to the exact page you want to capture, then reply 'ready'."
2. When they reply, spawn a new subagent with the same prompt above (Step 1), but note "the user has authenticated in the persistent browser profile — just navigate to `<URL>` and extract."
3. Auth state persists via the profile at `~/.claude/playwright-profile`.

#### What you get back

The subagent returns the compact design brief (not raw HTML/CSS). The raw files are saved in `./sge-capture/` if you need to verify anything. Use the Read tool to view `./sge-capture/reference.png` as a visual reference.

### Path B: URL → curl + raw CSS parsing (fallback if no Playwright MCP)

Use this when Playwright MCP isn't installed but the target site is reasonably static (landing pages, marketing sites, docs). It fails gracefully on heavily JS-rendered apps and can't handle auth.

Steps (run inline in the main conversation — no subagent needed):

1. **Fetch the HTML** with `curl -sL <url>` and save it to `./sge-capture/reference.html`. If output is large, save to a file via Bash and read with offset/limit.
2. **Find the stylesheets** by grepping for `rel="stylesheet"` and `href=` in the HTML. Most modern sites have a single built CSS file (e.g. Vite/webpack output).
3. **Fetch each stylesheet** with `curl -sL` and concatenate into `./sge-capture/reference.css`.
4. **Extract design tokens from the CSS**:
   - Colors: grep for hex patterns `#[0-9a-fA-F]{3,8}` and count occurrences — the most common ones are the real palette.
   - Fonts: find `@font-face` declarations and `font-family:` rules for the body and headings.
   - Tailwind classes: if the site uses Tailwind, the built CSS will have specific classes like `.text-5xl{font-size:3rem;line-height:1}` that map directly to typography tokens.
   - Border radius, shadows: grep for `rounded-` / `shadow-` / `border-radius:` / `box-shadow:`.
5. **Find page structure** in the HTML: grep for `<h1`, `<h2`, `<section`, `<nav`, `<footer` to get the section outline and exact heading text.
6. **Save a screenshot if you can** — if the user has access to any browser tool, ask them to drop a screenshot into `./sge-capture/reference.png`. Otherwise skip it.

This approach captures ~85% of fidelity compared to Playwright MCP — you miss: computed runtime values, lazy-loaded content, post-JS DOM mutations, and anything gated behind auth. But for a static marketing site it's often all you need.

### Path C: User pastes HTML/CSS + screenshot (always works)

If neither MCP nor curl works (JS-rendered SPA with no crawlable HTML, auth-gated site, or the user just wants to paste), ask the user to open dev tools and copy the HTML/CSS themselves.

Ask for:
- Right-click → Inspect → select `<html>` → Copy outer HTML → paste
- Optionally the main stylesheet content (from the Sources tab)
- A screenshot of the page

They might also paste specific CSS values from tools like VisBug ("the bg should be #1a1f36") — apply those literally.

If they only give a screenshot with no HTML/CSS, tell them you'll be guessing colors, fonts, and spacing — roughly ~70% fidelity — and offer to push harder for a URL or pasted CSS.

### Building `design.html`

With reference material in hand (from any path):

1. **Create `design.html`** in the current working directory. It must be a single self-contained HTML file. Apply the **Design Principles** at the bottom of this skill — they govern all HTML you write, in this phase and Phase 3.

2. **Match what you see, not what's declared.** The CSS file may contain hundreds of unused rules. Use `computed.json` (real browser-rendered values) and the screenshot as the source of truth for what's actually visible. The raw CSS is supporting evidence, not gospel.

3. **Preserve every detail you can.** Colors must match exactly. Fonts must match exactly (including weight — see the "shift one weight thinner" rule in the principles). Spacing, radii, shadows, borders — match them all.

### Phase 1 review gate (HITL — required)

This phase **does not end** until the user explicitly approves the result. Phase 2 depends on `design.html` being a faithful reference, so don't move on prematurely.

After creating `design.html`:

1. Tell the user: "Open `design.html` in your browser side-by-side with the original. How does it look? Tell me what to fix — colors, fonts, spacing, anything."
2. When they point out differences, fix them. They may paste specific values from VisBug or dev tools — use those literally.
3. Iterate until the user says something clearly affirmative ("looks good", "perfect", "ready for the styleguide step", etc.).
4. **Only then** suggest moving to `/sge styleguide`. Do not auto-advance.

### Output
- File: `design.html` in the current working directory
- (And `./sge-capture/` containing the raw extraction artifacts, if Path A was used)

---

## Phase 2: Style Guide (`/sge styleguide`)

**Goal:** Analyze the finished `design.html` and extract a comprehensive, reusable style guide.

### Prerequisites
- A `design.html` file exists in the working directory that the user has approved

If `./sge-capture/` also exists (from Phase 1 Path A), use `reference.css` and `computed.json` as additional evidence for verifying what's actually used.

### Process

1. **Read the source thoroughly** — Parse `design.html` (HTML structure, all inline styles, `<style>` blocks, Tailwind classes). If `./sge-capture/` exists, also read `reference.css` and `computed.json` for ground truth.

2. **Verify before documenting.** This is critical: for every color, font, spacing value, or pattern you document, verify it's actually used prominently. Stylesheets often contain rules that are defined but never applied, or only used in trivial/invisible ways. Cross-reference against `computed.json` if available — those are the real browser-rendered values. The style guide should reflect what's *visually present*, not what's merely declared.

3. **Write `styleguide.md`** with these sections:

   **Overview** — Brief description of the overall aesthetic (dark/light, minimal/rich, corporate/playful, etc.)

   **Color Palette** — Every color actually used, with hex values. Group by role: primary, secondary, accent, background, surface, text, border, etc. Note which colors are dominant vs. supporting.

   **Typography** — Font families, weights, and sizes for each text role (h1-h6, body, caption, button, nav, etc.). Pay special attention to how different fonts pair together. Note line heights and letter spacing where they deviate from defaults.

   **Spacing System** — Document the spacing scale used (is it 4px-based? 8px? Tailwind default?). Show common padding/margin patterns for sections, cards, buttons, etc.

   **Component Styles** — For each distinct component (buttons, cards, nav, inputs, badges, etc.): dimensions, colors, borders, padding, hover states, and any variants.

   **Shadows & Elevation** — All box-shadow values used, mapped to elevation levels (subtle, medium, high). Note where each level appears.

   **Animations & Transitions** — Any transitions on hover, focus, or load. Duration, easing, and which properties animate.

   **Border Radius** — The radius scale in use. Which elements get which radius (buttons vs. cards vs. avatars).

   **Opacity & Transparency** — Any use of opacity, rgba, or backdrop-blur. Where and why.

   **Tailwind CSS Patterns** — If the design uses Tailwind, document the most common utility patterns (e.g., "cards use `rounded-xl shadow-lg p-6 bg-white`").

   **Example Component Code** — Include 2-3 reference HTML snippets showing key components (a button, a card, a section) with the exact styles applied. These serve as copy-paste starting points.

### Output
- File: `styleguide.md` in the current working directory

---

## Phase 3: Build (`/sge build [description]`)

**Goal:** Generate new UI pages or components that faithfully follow the extracted style guide.

### Prerequisites
- A `styleguide.md` file exists in the working directory

### Process

1. **Read `styleguide.md`** in full. Also glance at `design.html` if it exists, as a visual reference.
2. **Understand the request.** The user's description (passed as arguments or in conversation) tells you what to build — could be a dashboard, landing page, settings panel, slide deck, anything.
3. **Generate a single self-contained HTML file** following the style guide and the **Design Principles** below.
4. Save as `output.html` by default, or whatever filename the user specifies.

---

## Design Principles (apply to all HTML output in this skill)

These principles produce high-fidelity, production-quality HTML. They apply to **both** Phase 1 (recreating `design.html`) and Phase 3 (building from the style guide).

### Response shape
- Start with a brief sentence describing what you're building, then the code, then a brief sentence about what to look at or try
- Don't mention tokens, Tailwind, or HTML by name in your prose to the user — just describe what the UI does

### Structure & framework
- Single self-contained HTML file with `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags
- Use HTML + Tailwind CSS via CDN. Apply Tailwind utilities directly on elements in the body — avoid setting Tailwind config or defining custom CSS classes
- When custom styles are needed beyond Tailwind, put them in the `style` attribute on the element
- No Tailwind classes on the `<html>` tag — put them on `<body>` or inner elements
- Make it responsive

### Respecting the source design
- **If reference design, code, or HTML is provided (Phase 1, or Phase 3 with a style guide): respect the original design, fonts, colors, and style as much as possible.** This is the most important rule for Phase 1.
- **If no style is specified by the user (Phase 3, no style guide):** design in the spirit of Linear, Stripe, Vercel, or Tailwind UI — but never name them in your output.

### Typography
- Be extremely precise with fonts — they make or break the style match
- For font weight, shift one level thinner than you'd expect (Bold → Semibold, Semibold → Medium). Browser rendering is heavier than design tools, so this compensates.
- Titles above 20px should use `tracking-tight`
- Match font pairings from the reference exactly

### Icons
- Use Lucide icons via CDN (`<script src="https://unpkg.com/lucide@latest"></script>`)
- Always `stroke-width="1.5"` — thinner strokes look more refined
- Avoid wrapping icons in gradient containers

### Interactive elements
- Checkboxes, sliders, dropdowns, and toggles should be custom-styled — never browser defaults. But don't add them gratuitously; only include if the UI calls for them.
- Add hover states: subtle color shifts, outline changes, gentle scale transforms
- Use Tailwind for animations (`transition`, `hover:`, `group-hover:`) — never JavaScript-driven animations

### Visual refinement
- Add subtle dividers and outlines between sections where appropriate
- Use subtle contrast — avoid harsh color jumps
- For logos, use letters with tight tracking, not image placeholders
- If images are needed and none specified, use Unsplash (`https://images.unsplash.com/photo-{id}?w=600`) — faces, 3D renders, abstract, landscapes

### Charts
- Use Chart.js via CDN if charts are needed
- Important canvas bug: never place `<canvas>` as a direct sibling of other block elements at the same level. Wrap it in a `<div>`. Direct sibling placement causes infinite canvas growth. Bad: `<h2><p><canvas><div>`. Good: `<h2><p><div><canvas></div><div>`.

### Theme defaults (Phase 3 only, when style guide is silent)
- Tech / cool / futuristic / developer-focused → dark mode
- Modern / traditional / professional / business → light mode
- If the style guide already specifies a theme, follow it

### What to avoid
- No floating "DOWNLOAD" button in the bottom-right corner
- No mentioning "Tailwind", "HTML", or token counts in your conversational response
- No JavaScript animation libraries
